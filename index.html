          <p>
            These days, we can hardly imagine life without applications that use
            databases built on SQL (structured query language). When saving just
            one piece of information, we usually use a simple text (txt) file.
            But when we need to store multiple values , a comma-separated values
            (csv) file comes to the rescue. Using tools like Google Sheets or
            SQL databases, we can easily perform functions like counting,
            averaging, and summing up data in rows and columns to make sense of
            it all. Datasets help us uncover hidden patterns, track trends, and
            even pinpoint that one specific case we're after. It's no
            exaggeration to say that databases and datasets are a huge part of
            our modern lives, making countless tasks so much easier. It's
            difficult to find an app that doesn't use a database. With
            technology ever-evolving, we can expect databases to stick around
            and keep making our lives better for the foreseeable future.

          <p style="text-align: right">
            With where we are with technology, it’s important to think about
            when a computing system needs to store massive amounts of data
            because we need to consider how the data will be stored and how to
            process data efficiently. As technology advances and the amount of
            data generated and collected grows exponentially, efficient storage
            and processing of massive data become crucial. Organizations must
            carefully select scalable storage solutions, employ efficient
            algorithms and parallel computing techniques, and implement proper
            data management to ensure data quality. Security, privacy, and
            ethical considerations, such as data encryption, access controls,
            and transparency, should also be taken into account to maintain data
            integrity and user trust. By addressing these concerns,
            organizations can leverage big data to drive innovation, enhance
            decision-making, and unlock new opportunities while adhering to
            ethical standards and ensuring data security and privacy.

          <p>
            This module offers a strong foundation in the realm of machine
            learning, touching on fundamental concepts such as reinforcement
            learning, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning. It delves
            into the intricacies of neural networks, a favored technique in
            supervised learning, elaborating on their composition and training
            process. The significance of diverse, high-quality training data is
            emphasized, stressing the need to tackle potential biases in the
            data to guarantee equitable and precise outcomes. Artificial
            intelligence enables us to accomplish remarkable feats like identity
            recognition, ethnicity detection, and even emotion detection.
            However, at present, these systems grapple with biases and fail to
            operate fairly for all individuals. AI faces significant challenges
            regarding inaccuracies in the criminal justice system, with many
            people of color wrongfully identified and arrested due to flawed
            facial recognition. Additionally, artificial intelligence struggles
            with translation between gender-neutral and gender-specific
            languages, particularly when discussing professions.

          <p style="text-align: right">
            The unit test was a great way to review my learning in the three
            modules. I scored 9 out of 9. It was pretty easy because throughout
            reading the modules, Khan Academy gives you practice questions to
            reinforce what I’ve just read. Some of the questions caught me off
            guard because it seemed like there were multiple right choices, and
            there was only one right choice. The unit test also does a good job
            of telling you whether you got the answer right before moving on to
            the next. It also gives you a reason why all the other answers are
            wrong.

        Data Analysis - Application and Presentation

        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>What’s the top 20 countries with the most contents on Netflix?</p>

      <div class="quest">
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          I started this process by finding a Netflix data set on Kaggle that
          gives me the necessary information, like the country in which the
          content is created in. After I download the dataset. I used Python and
          the pandas module to process data on a Kaggle notebook. After I
          imported the dataset, I used the matplotlib module to draw a visual
          presentation of how many movies are created in each country and limit
          it to the highest 20.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quest">
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>
          The data shows that United State have the most contents on Netflix
          with over 4000 movies and shows. Although India comes in second place
          with the most contents, most country in the top 20 have similar amount
          of contents.
