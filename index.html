          <p>
            These days, we can hardly imagine life without applications that use 
            databases built on structured query language (SQL). When saving information 
            that you don’t care about statistics, we usually use a simple text file. 
            Using tools like SQL databases or Excel, we can efficiently perform functions 
            like counting, averaging, and summing up data in rows and columns to make sense 
            of everything. Datasets help us uncover hidden patterns, track trends, and even 
            pinpoint that one specific case we're after. It's no exaggeration to say that 
            databases and datasets are a huge part of our modern lives, making countless 
            tasks so much easier. It's challenging to find an app that doesn't use a database. 
            With technology ever-evolving, we can expect databases to stick around and keep 
            making our lives better for the foreseeable future.

          <p style="text-align: right">
            With where we are with technology, it’s important to think about
            when a computing system needs to store massive amounts of data 
            because we need to consider how the data will be stored and how 
            to process data efficiently. As technology advances and the amount 
            of data generated and collected grows exponentially, efficient storage 
            and processing of massive data, become crucial. Organizations must 
            carefully select scalable storage solutions, employ efficient algorithms 
            and parallel computing techniques, and implement proper data management 
            to ensure data quality. Security, privacy, and ethical considerations, 
            such as data encryption, access controls, and transparency, should also 
            be considered to maintain data integrity and user trust. By addressing 
            these concerns, organizations can leverage big data to drive innovation, 
            enhance decision-making, and unlock new opportunities while adhering to 
            ethical standards and ensuring data security and privacy.

          <h2 style="text-align: center"class="header">Bias in Machine Learning</h2>
          <p>
            This module offers a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, 
            encompassing fundamental concepts such as reinforcement, unsupervised, 
            and supervised learning. It delves into neural networks, a widely used 
            technique in supervised learning, outlining their architecture and training 
            processes. The significance of diverse and high-quality training data is 
            underscored, emphasizing the need to tackle potential biases in the data 
            to guarantee equitable and precise outcomes. Artificial intelligence 
            enables us to accomplish remarkable tasks like identity recognition, 
            ethnicity detection, and emotion recognition. However, current AI 
            systems grapple with biases and fail to operate fairly for all individuals. 
            AI faces significant accuracy issues in the criminal justice system, 
            leading to the wrongful identification and arrest of many people of 
            color due to flawed facial recognition technology.

          <p style="text-align: right">
            The unit test was a great way to review my learning in the three
            modules. I scored 9 out of 9. It was pretty easy because throughout
            reading the modules, Khan Academy gives you practice questions to
            reinforce what I’ve just read. Some of the questions caught me off
            guard because it seemed like there were multiple right choices, and
            there was only one right choice. The unit test also does a good job
            of telling you whether you got the answer right before moving on to
            the next. It also gives you a reason why all the other answers are
            wrong.

        Data Analysis - Application and Presentation

        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>What’s the top 20 countries with the most contents on Netflix?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quest">
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
            I started this process by finding a Netflix data set on Kaggle that gives me the necessary information, 
            like the country in which the content is created in. This data contains 6234 rows and 12 columns. 
            After I download the dataset as a .csv file. I used Python and the pandas module to process data on a 
            Kaggle notebook. After I imported the dataset as a data frame, I used the matplotlib module to draw a 
            visual presentation of how many movies are created in each country and limit it to the highest 20.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quest">
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>
          The data shows that United State have the most contents on Netflix
          with over 4000 movies and shows. Although India comes in second place
          with the most contents, most country in the top 20 have similar amount
          of contents.
